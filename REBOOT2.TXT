REBOOT2:  A reboot utility for OS/2 systems

Using REBOOT2

Copy the files REBOOTDR.SYS and REBOOT2.EXE to a convenient place (here I'll
assume it's the root directory C:\).

Add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file for OS/2:
     DEVICE=C:\REBOOTDR.SYS

Reboot your computer and you should see the message "OS/2 reboot driver
loaded.  Type REBOOT2 to reboot system."

Now you can just type REBOOT2 to reboot your computer.
